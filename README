clasp is an answer set solver for (extended) normal and disjunctive
logic programs.  It combines the high-level modeling capacities of
ASP with state-of-the-art techniques from the area of Boolean
constraint solving. The primary clasp algorithm relies on conflict-driven
nogood learning, a technique that proved very successful for
satisfiability checking (SAT). Unlike other learning ASP solvers,
clasp does not rely on legacy software, such as a SAT solver or any
other existing ASP solver.  Rather, clasp has been genuinely developed
for answer set solving based on conflict-driven nogood learning.
clasp can be applied as an ASP solver (on SMODELS format, as output
by Gringo), as a SAT solver (on a simplified version of DIMACS/CNF
format), or as a PB solver (on OPB format).
