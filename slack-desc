# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

clasp: clasp (an answer set solver for logic programs)
clasp:
clasp: clasp is an answer set solver for (extended) normal and disjunctive
clasp: logic programs. It combines the high-level modeling capacities of ASP
clasp: with state-of-the-art techniques from the area of Boolean constraint
clasp: solving. The primary clasp algorithm relies on conflict-driven nogood
clasp: learning, a technique that proved very successful for satisfiability
clasp: checking (SAT).
